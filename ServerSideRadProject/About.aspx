    <p>Watch Shop is an official stockist for all watch brands listed on this website. Established in 1991 on the high street, Watch Shop is a leading retailer of brand name designer watches and is also the UK's most popular watch website*. Watch Shop was the first independent watch retailer to advertise on national television, and we pride ourselves on having one of the most efficient shopping systems available with communication at every stage to inform you of your order status, as well as excellent 7-days sales, customer service and support team who are glad to assist you with any enquiry.

We hold massive stock levels in our high capacity warehouse - with over 100,000 watches in stock - and display the stock level of each item on our website, so you can be sure that the product you are purchasing is in stock and available for immediate dispatch. 
        </p>
     <h2>Reasons why you should trust Watch Shop with your purchase</h2>
<h3>If it says In Stock, it's In Stock</h3>

We operate a live stock tracking system which means our physical stock is represented accurately on our website: if it's shown as being in stock on our site that means that we have the item in stock and ready for dispatch. Many other watch websites list thousands of watches on their website and wait until they receive your order before they try and obtain the watch from their sources, often causing delays of days or weeks.
<h3>Next day delivery</h3>

If you order before 4 pm then your order will be shipped the same day and should reach you the following day by Royal Mail or courier. (Terms and conditions apply - please see product page for delivery timescales).
<h3>All orders are shipped from the UK</h3>

We stock all products listed on this site in a UK secure premises. We do not ship from any other country, and we do not 'dropship' from manufacturers and can therefore guarantee delivery times. You buy from us confident in the knowledge that your purchase is in stock and shipped securely.
<h3>We are official stockists for all of our brands</h3>

This means all of our stock comes directly from the manufacturer and therefore comes with the correct instructions, packaging and valid guarantee. Many sites out there, who are unable to obtain official account status, will import from the 'grey market' meaning your watch could be from a number of countries such as Singapore and NOT include the official guarantee.
<h3>Full refund </h3>

If for any reason you are unhappy with your purchase, as long as it is in original and unworn condition, you can return it to us for a full refund within 30 days of delivery. Refund policies are extended over the Christmas period to allow your recipient to make up their mind.
<h3>Free watch bracelet adjustment</h3>

We adjust your watch bracelet for FREE. Metal bracelet adjustments normally mean a trip to the local jeweller but with our free watch bracelet adjustment you can wear your watch as soon as you receive it.
<h3>100% genuine watches and jewellery</h3>

Every item sold by Watch Shop is a 100% genuine item supplied to us directly from the manufacturer. We do not sell second hand or replica watches.
<h3>We only charge your card when the order is shipped</h3>

Other websites may take payment for the watch as you place your order, and then rally around trying to get the watch for you. We are proud to hold stock of every watch that is listed as "in stock".
<h3>100% secure online ordering</h3>

Your credit card details are transferred securely across our 128 bit SSL server. This means that they cannot be intercepted or read by anyone. Your credit card details are not stored on our server.
<h3>Established since 1991</h3>

We have been in the business of selling both watches and jewellery for over 20 years.
