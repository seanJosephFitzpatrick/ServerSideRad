    <a id="maintain">How do I maintain my watch?</a>
    </b></p>

    <p>
    Like any high-precision instrument, a watch needs to be serviced regularly in order for it to work perfectly. The intervals of service vary depending on the model, climate, and the care taken by the watch's owner. As a general rule, three to four years inbetween services are recommended depending on the use of the watch.
    </p>

    <p>
    We recommend cleaning your watch regularly using a soft cloth and luke warm water. After bathing in salt water, rinse your watch with fresh water and leave it to dry completely.
    </p>

    <p>
    Magnetic fields: Do not expose your watch to intense magnetic fields such as loudspeakers or refrigerators and other electromagnetic appliances.
    </p>

    <p>
    Shocks: Whether thermal or other shocks, avoid them. In the event of violent shocks, please have your watch checked by an authorized Service Center.
    </p>

    <p>
    Crown: depending on model, push or screw it in carefully to ensure that no water enters the mechanism.
    </p>

    <p>
    Cleaning: for metal bracelets and for all water-resistant cases use a toothbrush with soapy water and a soft cloth for drying.
    </p>

    <p>
    Chemical products: avoid direct contact with solvents, detergents, perfumes, cosmetic products etc., since they may damage the bracelet, the case or the gaskets.
    </p>

    <p>
    Temperatures: Do not expose your watch to sudden temperature changes (exposure to sunlight followed by immersion in cold water) or extreme temperatures over 60C (140F) or under than 0C (32F).
